I fell off a ladder.' Additionally, it can describe past habits or repeated actions, sometimes using frequency adverbs (e.g., 'He always visited us when he was young') or the phrase 'used to' (e.g., 'When I was young, I used to play in the street'), and can indicate the duration of a past action using 'for,' as in 'My father went to a primary school for 6 years.'\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name='Hypothetical and Advanced Uses of the Past Simple Tense', summary=\"Beyond its primary function, the Past Simple tense is employed in several advanced and hypothetical constructions.

Furthermore, it follows 'wish' and 'if only' to express wishes or regrets about the present (e.g., 'I wish I lived near my school'), and is used with 'supposing/suppose' to imagine unlikely or unreal scenarios (e.g., 'Suppose you met the president, what would you ask him to do?'). It also appears after 'as if/as though' for comparisons (e.g., 'Ahmed treats us as if he were a king') and after 'It's time' or 'It's high time' to indicate that an action should happen immediately (e.g., 'It’s time you went to bed').\"),\n",

It is used for a short, completed action that interrupts an ongoing action described by the Past Continuous tense, as seen in 'While Ali was climbing the ladder, he fell down,' where 'fell down' is the interrupting action. Additionally, it describes the second event in a sequence when the first event has already been completed, with the first event typically expressed in the Past Perfect tense, such as 'After he had booked the ticket, he took the train,' illustrating a clear chronological order of past actions.\")\n",

      " The Past Simple tense is primarily used to describe actions that started and finished at a specific time in the past, often indicated by time expressions like 'yesterday' or 'a week ago,' as in 'It rained heavily yesterday.' It also narrates a sequence of completed past actions, recounting events in stories (e.g., 'Jehan wiped the table after dinner, took a shower and went to bed'), and provides specific details about events that occurred after an action described by the present perfect tense, such as 'I’ve hurt my leg. I fell off a ladder.' Additionally, it can describe past habits or repeated actions, sometimes using frequency adverbs (e.g., 'He always visited us when he was young') or the phrase 'used to' (e.g., 'When I was young, I used to play in the street'), and can indicate the duration of a past action using 'for,' as in 'My father went to a primary school for 6 years.'\n",

      " Beyond its primary function, the Past Simple tense is employed in several advanced and hypothetical constructions. It is used after 'would rather' with a subject to express a present preference (e.g., 'I’d rather you went to school today'), and forms the 'if' clause of the second conditional to describe unlikely or hypothetical present/future situations (e.g., 'If I discovered a new planet, I’d give it my name'). Furthermore, it follows 'wish' and 'if only' to express wishes or regrets about the present (e.g., 'I wish I lived near my school'), and is used with 'supposing/suppose' to imagine unlikely or unreal scenarios (e.g., 'Suppose you met the president, what would you ask him to do?'). It also appears after 'as if/as though' for comparisons (e.g., 'Ahmed treats us as if he were a king') and after 'It's time' or 'It's high time' to indicate that an action should happen immediately (e.g., 'It’s time you went to bed').\n",

It is used for a short, completed action that interrupts an ongoing action described by the Past Continuous tense, as seen in 'While Ali was climbing the ladder, he fell down,' where 'fell down' is the interrupting action. Additionally, it describes the second event in a sequence when the first event has already been completed, with the first event typically expressed in the Past Perfect tense, such as 'After he had booked the ticket, he took the train,' illustrating a clear chronological order of past actions.\n",
