For interrogative (questions), it uses 'Did + subject + infinitive,' as in 'Did Maher invite you to the party last Friday?' or 'Wh-word + did + subject + infinitive' for Wh-questions like 'What did you study last night?' The negative form follows the structure 'Subject + didn’t + infinitive,' exemplified by 'My son didn’t use mobile phones 10 years ago,' indicating a completed action that did not occur in the past.\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name='Past Simple Passive Voice', summary=\"The Past Simple tense in the passive voice is constructed using the object of the action, followed by 'was' or 'were,' and then the past participle (P.P.) of the main verb, to describe an action that was performed on the object in the past, such as 'The pyramids were built by the ancient Egyptians.' This form emphasizes the recipient of the action rather than the performer.\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name=\"Past Simple of the Verb 'To Be'\", summary=\"The verb 'to be' has unique past simple forms: 'was' for singular subjects (I, he, she, it) and 'were' for plural subjects (you, we, they), which are used to describe states of being or conditions in the past. These forms are applicable in affirmative statements, negative constructions (e.g., 'I wasn't at school'), and questions (e.g., 'Were you at home?'), as illustrated by 'I was at school last Monday.'\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name=\"Expressing Past Possession with 'Had'\", summary=\"Past possession is expressed using the verb 'had' (the past simple of 'to have'), which indicates ownership or possession in the past. For affirmative statements, the structure is 'Subject + had + object,' as in 'I had a nice bike when I was young,' while the negative form uses 'Subject + didn’t have + object,' such as 'I didn’t have a bike when I was young.'\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name='Core Uses of the Past Simple Tense', summary=\"The Past Simple tense is primarily used to describe actions that started and finished at a specific time in the past, often indicated by time expressions like 'yesterday' or 'a week ago,' as in 'It rained heavily yesterday.' It also narrates a sequence of completed past actions, recounting events in stories (e.g., 'Jehan wiped the table after dinner, took a shower and went to bed'), and provides specific details about events that occurred after an action described by the present perfect tense, such as 'I’ve hurt my leg. I fell off a ladder.' Additionally, it can describe past habits or repeated actions, sometimes using frequency adverbs (e.g., 'He always visited us when he was young') or the phrase 'used to' (e.g., 'When I was young, I used to play in the street'), and can indicate the duration of a past action using 'for,' as in 'My father went to a primary school for 6 years.'\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name='Hypothetical and Advanced Uses of the Past Simple Tense', summary=\"Beyond its primary function, the Past Simple tense is employed in several advanced and hypothetical constructions. It is used after 'would rather' with a subject to express a present preference (e.g., 'I’d rather you went to school today'), and forms the 'if' clause of the second conditional to describe unlikely or hypothetical present/future situations (e.g., 'If I discovered a new planet, I’d give it my name'). Furthermore, it follows 'wish' and 'if only' to express wishes or regrets about the present (e.g., 'I wish I lived near my school'), and is used with 'supposing/suppose' to imagine unlikely or unreal scenarios (e.g., 'Suppose you met the president, what would you ask him to do?'). It also appears after 'as if/as though' for comparisons (e.g., 'Ahmed treats us as if he were a king') and after 'It's time' or 'It's high time' to indicate that an action should happen immediately (e.g., 'It’s time you went to bed').\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name='Associated Time Expressions for the Past Simple Tense', summary=\"The Past Simple tense is frequently accompanied by specific time expressions that clearly indicate a completed action in the past, helping to establish the timeframe of the event. Common associated time expressions include 'yesterday,' 'last + period' (e.g., last week, last year), 'period + ago' (e.g., an hour ago, a month ago), 'in + year' (e.g., in 2002), 'the other day,' and 'a month ago,' all of which signal that the action occurred and concluded at a definite point in the past.\"),\n",
    "    MainIdea(name='Interactions of Past Simple with Other Past Tenses', summary=\"The Past Simple tense often interacts with other past tenses to describe complex sequences of events. It is used for a short, completed action that interrupts an ongoing action described by the Past Continuous tense, as seen in 'While Ali was climbing the ladder, he fell down,' where 'fell down' is the interrupting action. Additionally, it describes the second event in a sequence when the first event has already been completed, with the first event typically expressed in the Past Perfect tense, such as 'After he had booked the ticket, he took the train,' illustrating a clear chronological order of past actions.\")\n",

Additionally, it can describe past habits or repeated actions, sometimes using frequency adverbs (e.g., 'He always visited us when he was young') or the phrase 'used to' (e.g., 'When I was young, I used to play in the street'), and can indicate the duration of a past action using 'for,' as in 'My father went to a primary school for 6 years.'\n",

Furthermore, it follows 'wish' and 'if only' to express wishes or regrets about the present (e.g., 'I wish I lived near my school'), and is used with 'supposing/suppose' to imagine unlikely or unreal scenarios (e.g., 'Suppose you met the president, what would you ask him to do?'). It also appears after 'as if/as though' for comparisons (e.g., 'Ahmed treats us as if he were a king') and after 'It's time' or 'It's high time' to indicate that an action should happen immediately (e.g., 'It’s time you went to bed').\n",
